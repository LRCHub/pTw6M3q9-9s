Overkill, have you had your fill?
Come to expect it off the wall
Too short or too tall, system rejects it

I've lost the handle, what's it all been for?
Tired of trying, seeing so much more

It's so predictable and everybody judges
By the numbers that you're selling
Just crank 'em out the assembly line
And chart 'em higher
(Higher, higher)

Yeah, just keep it simple, boys
It's gonna be alright
As long as you're inside the mainstream

Are we moving too far away?
(Mainstream)
Is it worth it if it doesn't pay?
(Mainstream)
The centerline is status quo

Gonna stay within the
(Mainstream)
If you stay within the tried and true
(Mainstream)
You'll remain among the chosen few
(Mainstream)
Survive another year

The market is dead
Accounts in the red, media saturation
We're deep in a rut
The artery's is cut, sensory deprivation

Really loved it, didn't earn a cent
No one's buying your experiment

It's so predictable and everybody judges
By the numbers that you're selling
Just crank 'em out the assembly line
And chart 'em higher
(Higher, higher)

Oh just keep it simple, boys
It's gonna be alright
As long as you're inside the
(Mainstream)

Are we moving too far away?
(Mainstream)
Is it worth it if it doesn't pay?
(Mainstream)
The centerline is status quo

Gonna stay inside the
(Mainstream)
For the masses in consumer land
(Mainstream)
Give 'em everything that they demand
(Mainstream)
Survive another year

Yeah corporate mold, packaged and sold
16 to 30, jobbers and racks
They're moving in stacks
Tactics are dirty

We're in business, what else is it for?
Profit motive, welcome to the war

It's so predictable and everybody judges
By the numbers that you're selling
Just crank 'em out the assembly line
And chart 'em higher
(Higher, higher)

Just keep it simple, boys
It's gonna be alright
As long as you're inside the
(Mainstream)

Are we moving too far away?
(Mainstream)
Is it worth it if it doesn't pay?
(Mainstream)
The centerline is status quo

Gonna stay inside the
(Mainstream)
Just be careful not to rearrange
(Mainstream)
Don't let 'em catch you getting strange
(Mainstream)
Survive another year
